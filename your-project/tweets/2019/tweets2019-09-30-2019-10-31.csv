HappyPawsTreats,ForestgrumpOz,Amazing. Britain goes to the polls Dec 12th. Prediction New PM (not necessarily Johnson) wins by a huge majority &amp; 'no deal' Brexit happens within days. Trump &amp; Johnson have been wking together. Trump can put harsher sanctions on the EU to 'bring them to heel'.
